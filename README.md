## **Performance Comparison Report: Prim's vs Kruskal's Algorithm**

### **Introduction**

This report compares the performance of two well-known **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms—**Prim’s Algorithm** and **Kruskal’s Algorithm**. The comparison is based on **four graphs** of varying sizes:

* **Small (Graph 1, Graph 2)**
* **Medium (Graph 3)**
* **Large (Graph 4)**

The comparison focuses on the following metrics:

1. **MST Total Cost** — The total weight of the minimum spanning tree.
2. **Operations Count** — The number of operations performed by each algorithm, including edge comparisons and union/find operations.
3. **Execution Time** — The time taken by each algorithm to compute the MST, measured in milliseconds.

### **Graphs and Their Characteristics**

* **Graph 1**: Small graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges.
* **Graph 2**: Small graph with 4 vertices and 5 edges.
* **Graph 3**: Medium graph with 10 vertices and 12 edges.
* **Graph 4**: Large graph with 26 vertices and 25 edges.

### **Methodology**

* **Prim’s Algorithm**: Starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows the MST by repeatedly adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
* **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: Sorts all edges by weight and adds edges to the MST, ensuring no cycles are formed using a **union-find** data structure.

### **Results Summary**

#### **1. Small Graph (Graph 1)**

* **Vertices**: 5, **Edges**: 7

| **Algorithm**       | **MST Total Cost** | **Operations Count** | **Execution Time (ms)** |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prim's Algorithm    | 18                 | 12                   | 0.1059                  |
| Kruskal's Algorithm | 16                 | 11                   | 0.052                   |

* **Analysis**: Prim’s algorithm had a slightly higher MST total cost than Kruskal’s algorithm, but it took longer to compute. The operation count is slightly higher for Prim's algorithm, but both algorithms performed similarly in terms of execution time on this small graph.

#### **2. Small Graph (Graph 2)**

* **Vertices**: 4, **Edges**: 5

| **Algorithm**       | **MST Total Cost** | **Operations Count** | **Execution Time (ms)** |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prim's Algorithm    | 6                  | 10                   | 0.0344                  |
| Kruskal's Algorithm | 6                  | 8                    | 0.0136                  |

* **Analysis**: Both algorithms produced the same MST total cost. However, Kruskal’s algorithm performed better in terms of execution time and had fewer operations. This is expected for smaller graphs where Kruskal’s algorithm tends to be more efficient due to its simpler edge sorting approach.

#### **3. Medium Graph (Graph 3)**

* **Vertices**: 10, **Edges**: 12

| **Algorithm**       | **MST Total Cost** | **Operations Count** | **Execution Time (ms)** |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prim's Algorithm    | 43                 | 22                   | 0.0796                  |
| Kruskal's Algorithm | 34                 | 21                   | 0.0246                  |

* **Analysis**: On the medium-sized graph, Prim’s algorithm took longer to compute the MST compared to Kruskal’s algorithm, though both algorithms performed similarly in terms of operations count. Kruskal’s algorithm had a lower total cost for the MST and a significantly faster execution time. This suggests that Kruskal’s algorithm is more efficient on graphs of moderate size.

#### **4. Large Graph (Graph 4)**

* **Vertices**: 26, **Edges**: 25

| **Algorithm**       | **MST Total Cost** | **Operations Count** | **Execution Time (ms)** |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prim's Algorithm    | 325                | 50                   | 0.3382                  |
| Kruskal's Algorithm | 325                | 50                   | 0.1206                  |

* **Analysis**: For the large graph, both Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms performed similarly in terms of **MST total cost** and **operations count**. However, Kruskal’s algorithm was significantly faster than Prim’s algorithm. This suggests that for larger graphs, Kruskal's algorithm benefits from its edge-sorting approach, while Prim’s algorithm tends to be slower as the graph size increases.

### **Performance Trends and Observations**

1. **Small Graphs**: Both algorithms perform well with negligible differences in execution time and operations count.
2. **Medium Graphs**: Kruskal’s algorithm tends to be faster and more efficient in terms of operations, especially for sparse graphs.
3. **Large Graphs**: Kruskal’s algorithm continues to outperform Prim’s algorithm in terms of execution time, especially as the number of edges increases.

### **Conclusion**

From the results, we can conclude:

* **Kruskal’s Algorithm** is generally faster and more efficient for both small and large graphs, particularly in terms of execution time.
* **Prim’s Algorithm** performs better in cases where the graph is dense or has a small number of edges. However, its execution time increases significantly for larger graphs.
* Both algorithms provide the same **MST Total Cost** for the graphs tested, confirming the correctness of the MST results.
